/**
 * <p>
 * The {@code ThreadingDetector} class is designed to help detect and handle potential threading issues
 * in concurrent environments. It provides mechanisms to lock and unlock resources while checking for
 * thread contention, and it logs detailed stack traces when multiple threads attempt to access the same
 * resource simultaneously.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is particularly useful in debugging and testing scenarios where ensuring that certain code
 * paths are not accessed concurrently is critical.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage Example:</b>
 * <pre>{@code
 * ThreadingDetector detector = new ThreadingDetector("ResourceName");
 * try {
 *     detector.checkAndLock();
 *     // Perform thread-sensitive operations
 * } catch (Exception e) {
 *     e.printStackTrace();
 * } finally {
 *     try {
 *         detector.checkAndUnlock();
 *     } catch (Exception e) {
 *         e.printStackTrace();
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
