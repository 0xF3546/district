/**
 * The {@code SystemCollector} interface defines the contract for collecting and accessing

 * methods to gather information about the operating system, Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
 * memory usage, and other relevant system properties.
 *
 * <p>Typical use cases include monitoring system health, performance analytics, and gathering
 * runtime environment details for logging or diagnostic purposes.</p>
 *
 * <p>Methods provided by this interface should return the latest snapshot of the system's state,
 * and it is expected that an implementation class periodically refreshes the collected data.</p>
