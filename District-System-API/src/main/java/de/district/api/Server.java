/**
 * The {@code Server} interface defines the contract for accessing various

 * <p>This interface is a central point of interaction for obtaining instances
 * of important services such as logging, plugin data management, system information
 * collection, and versioning within a Minecraft-based server environment.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface should ensure that the methods return
 * the appropriate resources or services configured for the server. This
 * includes providing access to Spring-managed beans through the {@link #getBean(Class)}
 * method, which facilitates the retrieval of Spring components by type.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface is designed to be implemented within the core module of the
 * application, with the expectation that the API module remains agnostic of the
 * core's implementation details.</p>
